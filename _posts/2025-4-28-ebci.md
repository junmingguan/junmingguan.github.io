_**In progess**_. This note summarizes the methods proposed by Ignadiatis and Wager 2022.
##### Setup

Suppose we have following model 

$$
\begin{equation}
    Z_i = \mu_i + \epsilon_i, \hspace{1cm}
        \mu_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} G\in \mathcal{G}, \hspace{1cm}
        \epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1),
\end{equation}
$$

for some prior class $\mathcal{G}$. We are interested in estimating $\theta_G(z)=\mathbb{E}_G[h(\mu)\mid Z=z]$ for some function \\(h\\) and forming confidence intervals for the estimates. Ignadiatis and Wager propose two approaches for this task: \\(F\\)-localization and AMARI.

##### $F$-localization 

**Idea**: find a level-$\alpha$ set of distribution functions $\mathcal{F}_n(\alpha)$ for the true marginal distribution function $F_G$, i.e.,

$$
\lim \inf_{n\to \infty} \mathbb{P}_G\Big[ F_G \in \mathcal{F}_n(\alpha)\Big] \geq 1-\alpha.
$$

For $z$ of interest, identify all $\hat{G}$ such that $F_{\widehat{G}}$ lies inside $$\mathcal{F}_n(\alpha)$$. Now that we have a set of $\theta_{\widehat{G}}(z)$'s, we can simply take and maximum and minimum to form a confidence band.

##### AMARI 

**Prerequisite: bias-aware confidence intervals**

Suppose we have some estimate $\hat{m}$ of some functional $m \in \mathcal{M}$ with standard error ${se}(\hat{m}(x_0))$. Denote the worse case bias by $B = \text{sup}_{m \in \mathcal{M}}\|\hat{m}(x_0) - m(x_0)\|$. Then a naive confidence interval for $m(x_0)$ is

$$
\hat{m}(x_0) \pm (B + t_{1-\alpha/2} se(\hat{m}(x_0))).
$$

To make the length of the CI as short as possible, a better one is given by

$$
\hat{m}(x_0) \pm t_\alpha (se(\hat{m}(x_0)), B),
$$

where

$$
t_\alpha (se(\hat{m}(x_0)), B) = \inf \big\{ t > 0: \forall |b| \leq B: \mathbb{P}[|Z_b| \leq t] \geq \alpha\big\},
$$

and $Z_b \sim \mathcal{N}(b, se(\hat{m}(x_0))^2)$.


**Non-identifiability in the Bernoulli Model**

Consider the model $Z_i \mid \mu_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\mu_i)$, and $\mu_i\sim G\in\mathcal{P}([0,1])$. Then we have $p(Z_i \mid \mu_i) = \mu_i^{z_i}(1-\mu_i)^{1-z_i}$, $
f_G(1) = \int \mu dG(\mu)$, and $f_G(0) = 1 - f_G(1)$. So the marginal distribution \\(f_G\\) of \\(Z\\) is determined by \\(f_G(1)\\).

The second moment \\(L(G)=\int \mu^2 dG(\mu)\\) is not point-identified. Different priors \\(G\\) with the same \\(f_G(1)\\), \\(L(G)\\) could have different \\(L(G)\\). The maximum is attained at \\(G\\) such that \\(\PP_G[\\{1\\}]=f_G(1)\\) and \\(\PP_G[\\{0\\}] = f_G(0)\\). In this case, \\(L(G) = \text{Var}_G(\mu)+(f_G(1))^2 = f_G(1)\\). The minimum is attained at \\(\PP_G[\\{f_G(1)\\}]=1\\), with \\(L(G) = f_G(1)^2\\).
